I made this project to try out the Braintree API with a full MEAN application.

Angular Seed Starter Kit was forked and cloned from: https://github.com/angular/angular-seed

Type "npm install" in the console before running the server. This command was preconfigured by the AngularSeed owner to install bower_components in the /app directory. You'll find this configuration in the package.json file.

I added the server folder and server.js to make this into a full MEAN project.
Removed and renamed some files and folders from the original starter kit.

Note: It's not a real-money-transaction donation app. No money will be forwarded to anyone using the default credit card values in the Braintree sandbox.
